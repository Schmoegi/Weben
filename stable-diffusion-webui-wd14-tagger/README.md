## Disclaimer
I didn't make any models, and most of the code was heavily borrowed from the [DeepDanbooru](https://github.com/KichangKim/DeepDanbooru) and MrSmillingWolf's tagger.

## Installation
1. *Extensions* -> *Install from URL* -> Enter URL of this repository -> Press *Install* button
   - or clone this repository under `extensions/`
      ```sh
      $ git clone https://github.com/toriato/stable-diffusion-webui-wd14-tagger.git extensions/tagger
      ```

1. Add interrogate model
   - #### *MrSmilingWolf's model (a.k.a. Waifu Diffusion 1.4 tagger)*
      Downloads automatically from the [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf/wd-v1-4-vit-tagger) the first time you run it.

      Please ask the original author MrSmilingWolf#5991 for questions related to model or additional training.

      ##### ViT vs Convnext
      > To make it clear: the ViT model is the one used to tag images for WD 1.4. That's why the repo was originally called like that. This one has been trained on the same data and tags, but has got no other relation to WD 1.4, aside from stemming from the same coordination effort. They were trained in parallel, and the best one at the time was selected for WD 1.4

      > This particular model was trained later and might actually be slightly better than the ViT one. Difference is in the noise range tho

      1. Move the project folder containing the model and config to `models/deepdanbooru`

      1. The file structure should look like:
